//! Core of the MW Master app: private SQLite storage, backups and reading the
//! shared data folder. No Tauri dependency, so it builds and tests anywhere.
//!
//! All grade maths, validation of the shared data and statistics live in the
//! TypeScript frontend (`src/logic`). This crate only stores and moves data.
